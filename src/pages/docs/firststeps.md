description: Your first steps getting started with Geez.

If you're new to using Geez, follow these initial steps to set up and configure your environment.

After you've successfully installed Geez, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```shell
geez init
```

{% callout type="note" title="Don't Be Scared" %}
Don't worry, you won't receive any emails from `Geez`. When you run `geez init`, it will prompt you to provide your email address and name. These details are required by Git to associate your name and email with any changes you make.

{% /callout %}

Running `geez init` will create your configuration file, and it will be symlinked to `$GEEZ/.geez.yml`. Feel free to open this configuration file with your favorite text editor and take a closer look at its contents.

For a better understanding of Geez's core concepts, we recommend reading through the Core Concepts documentation before you proceed.

Now you're all set to start using Geez with confidence!
